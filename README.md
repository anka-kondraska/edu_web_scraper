edu_web_scraper

Overview:<br/>
edu_web_scraper scrapes the web, specifically google search results for gender and educational information
based on full name and email address.

It takes a csv file as input with full name and email address columns. It runs google search on each name
and/or email address and scrapes the educational degree and educational institution associated with each name
and/or email adddress. It also scrapes gednerize.io and behindthename.com for gender information
based on first name.

At this point it is a script file. There is no UI to speak of. To run it in your terminal specify 
the script file and test names/emails csv file to be discovered:<br/>
python gapjump.py test_profiles.csv
