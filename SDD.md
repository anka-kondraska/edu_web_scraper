edu_web_scraper

Overview:<br/>
edu_web_scraper scrapes the web, specifically google search results for gender and educational information
based on full name and email address.

It takes a csv file as input with full name and email address columns. It runs google search on each name
and/or email address and scrapes the educational degree and educational institution associated with each name
and/or email adddress. It also scrapes genderize.io and behindthename.com for gender information
based on first name.

At this point it is a Python script. There is no UI to speak of. To run it in your terminal specify 
the script file and test names/emails csv file to be discovered:<br/>

python gapjump.py test_profiles.csv

Upon completion pie chart is saved to your local directory/machine with the degree breakdown
among the individuals listed in the csv file.

The database consists of one table at this time. Once I gain a better understanding
of this project it can be redone and migrated. As it stand, the one table has six columns:
last_name, middle_name, first_name, gender, degree_earned, university_attended. 

In the future, data can be broken out into three tables: name and email, gender, degree_earned and
university_attended.

All data - the name and email info fed from the csv file and the discovered
gender and educational data - is encrypted using postgres pgcrypto extension and blowfish algorithm.

Reason for this choice is that it is sensitive data for blind auditions, and pgcrypto
is highly reliable scalable solution alreday build into postgres.
